# google-data-analysis-cert-case-studies
A code repository for my case study capstone project for the Google Data Analytics professional certificate.

Below is the project description from Coursera: "You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of
marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your
team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will
design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your
recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations."

This repository includes the dataset as a Rdata file and my completed exploratory data analysis as an R Markdown file. Output can be found in the link to RPubs in my profile.

NOTE: This was my first-ever exploratory data analysis. Some areas could've been reworked for clarity or for further depth, however I chose to leave it as is to showcase
progress and growth in my coding skills. There are two Markdown files: "Cyclistic Bike Share - Case Study ORIGINAL" and "Cyclistic Bike Share - Case Study REVISED." The original
version is the file as it was when written a year ago, and the file paths have been removed to protect my device information. The revised version is edited for minor clarity (specifically
in the notes) and for functionality (for example, replacing base-R functions or clunky blocks of code with tidyverse functions). NOTE: RPubs contains the output for the revised Markdown
file. Originally the data was given as separate CSV files corresponding to each month within the scope of the project. For ease of use and reproducibility, I combined them in a separate 
script (not uploaded) and saved them as a Rdata file.
